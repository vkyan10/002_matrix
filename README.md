# 002_matrix
Implementation of backend edge matrix.

General Matrix stuff
- matrix multiplication
- creation of an identity matrix
- displaying a matrix in a reasonable manner

Graphics matrix stuff
- add a point to an edge matrix
- add an edge to an edge matrix (should call your add point routine)
- go through an edge matrix and draw the lines stored in the matrix (should call your draw line routine)

Create a main function/method that demonstrates all the of matrix routines you wrote, and generates an image using the edge matrix structure.
